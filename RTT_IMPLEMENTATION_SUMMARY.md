# RTT Implementation Summary

## Analysis Results

After examining the qperf codebase, I found that **RTT (Round Trip Time) measurements were NOT implemented** in the original code. The tool only measured:

- Connection establishment time
- Time to first byte
- Throughput (bandwidth per second)
- Packet statistics (sent, lost, congestion window)

## Changes Made

I've successfully added RTT measurement functionality to both client and server sides:

### 1. Client-Side RTT Measurement (`client_stream.c`)

**Changes:**
- Added static connection reference to access QUIC stats
- Modified the report callback to include RTT measurements
- Added `client_stream_set_connection()` function to set connection reference
- RTT is displayed alongside throughput in each second's report

**New Output Format:**
```
second 0: 3.144 gbit/s (422030372 bytes received) RTT: 25.43ms
second 1: 3.444 gbit/s (462189378 bytes received) RTT: 23.67ms
```

### 2. Server-Side RTT Measurement (`server_stream.c`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `print_report()` function to include RTT in periodic reports
- Added RTT to final connection summary
- RTT is calculated from QUIC connection statistics

**New Output Format:**
```
connection 0 second 0 send window: 1112923 packets sent: 364792 packets lost: 373 RTT: 25.43ms
connection 0 second 1 send window: 1238055 packets sent: 377515 packets lost: 123 RTT: 23.67ms
connection 0 total packets sent: 3654759 total packets lost: 2922 final RTT: 24.55ms
```

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements

**Added to `common.h` and `common.c`:**
- Missing function declarations: `resolve_address`, `setup_session_cache`, etc.
- Basic placeholder implementations for TLS/certificate functions
- Fixed include dependencies across all source files

**Fixed Missing Includes:**
- Added `string.h`, `assert.h`, `inttypes.h` where needed
- Ensured all compilation dependencies are satisfied

## Implementation Details

### RTT Data Source
RTT measurements are obtained from the QUIC connection's internal statistics:
```c
quicly_stats_t stats;
quicly_get_stats(conn, &stats);
double rtt_ms = (double)stats.rtt.smoothed / 1000.0; // Convert Î¼s to ms
```

### Key Functions Added
- `client_stream_set_connection(quicly_conn_t *conn)` - Sets connection reference for RTT access
- Modified `report_cb()` in client_stream.c - Includes RTT in client reports
- Modified `print_report()` in server_stream.c - Includes RTT in server reports

## Expected Benefits

1. **Network Latency Visibility**: Users can now see RTT alongside throughput
2. **Performance Analysis**: RTT trends help identify network conditions
3. **Debugging**: RTT measurements aid in diagnosing network issues
4. **Complete Picture**: Combined with existing metrics, provides comprehensive performance view

## Build Requirements

The implementation depends on:
- QUIC library (quicly) with stats support
- All existing dependencies (libev, OpenSSL, etc.)

## Usage

No new command-line options required. RTT measurements are automatically included in all performance reports when using qperf in both client and server modes.
